# Order matters. When creating path operations, you can find situations where you have a fixed path.
# Like /users/me, let's say that it's to get data about the current user.
# And then you can also have a path /users/{user_id} to get data about a specific user by some user ID.
# Because path operations are evaluated in order, you need to make sure that the path for /users/me is declared before the one for /users/{user_id}

# Predefined valuesÂ¶
# Create an Enum class, that inherits from str and Enum
# By inheriting from str the API docs will be able to know that the values must be of type string and will be able to render correctly.

# Path convertor
# Using an option directly from Starlette you can declare a path parameter containing a path using a URL like:
# /files/{file_path:path}
# In this case, the name of the parameter is file_path, and the last part, :path, tells it that the parameter should match any path.
